# Penguin Species Prediction using K-Means Clustering

## Overview
This project aims to predict the species of penguins between Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap using the K-Means clustering model of machine learning. The dataset used for training and prediction contains various features such as bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass of different penguins.

## Requirements
To run the penguin species prediction project, you will need the following:

Python (version 3.x)
Jupyter Notebook or any other Python IDE
Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project should be a CSV file containing penguin data, including features and the species labels. The dataset should have the following columns:

species: The target variable containing penguin species labels (Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap).
bill_length_mm: Numeric value representing the bill length of penguins.
bill_depth_mm: Numeric value representing the bill depth of penguins.
flipper_length_mm: Numeric value representing the flipper length of penguins.
body_mass_g: Numeric value representing the body mass of penguins.
Make sure the dataset is located in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook or update the file path accordingly.

## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook (penguin_prediction.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook or any other Python IDE.
Execute the code cells one by one to load the dataset, perform data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
The trained K-Means clustering model will predict the species of the penguins in the dataset.
You can also use the trained model to predict the species of new penguin data by providing values for bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, and body_mass_g.

## Methodology
Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to understand its structure and distribution of features.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables (if any), and scale the numerical features.
Data Visualization: Visualize the distribution of features, perform feature correlations, and create plots to gain insights.
Model Training: Use the K-Means clustering algorithm to cluster penguins into three groups based on their features.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (if ground truth labels are available).

## Prediction: Use the trained model to predict the species of penguins based on their feature values.
